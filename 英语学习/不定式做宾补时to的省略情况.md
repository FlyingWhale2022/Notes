动词不定式作使役动词和感官动词的宾语补足语时，要省略 to, 但在变被动语态的时候必须加上 to (let 除外），动词 help 后面的动词不定式可以带 to，也可以不带 to


The boss makes the workers work for a long time every day. 老板让工人们每天工作很长时间。

（变为被动语态：The workers are made to work for a long time every day by the boss.)
  
My mom helps me (to) do my homework every night. 我妈妈每晚帮助我做作业。

  
使役动词 let, have, make

感官动词 see, watch, look at, notice , observe, hear, listen to, smell, feel, find 等后作宾补，省略to。
  
注意：在被动语态中则to 不能省掉。

I saw him dance.

=He was seen to dance.

The boss made them work the whole night.

=They were made to work the whole night.

  

例题：Paul doesn't have to be made ().  He always works hard.  

A. learn　 B. to learn　 C. learned　 D. learning

答案：B. make后接不带to 的动词不定式，当其用于被动时，to 不可省略
