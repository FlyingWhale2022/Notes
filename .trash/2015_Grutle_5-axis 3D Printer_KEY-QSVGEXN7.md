> 3D printers have in recent years become extremely popular. Even though 3D printing technology have existed since the late 1980's, it is now considered one of the most significant technological breakthroughs of the twenty-first century. Several different 3D printing processes have been invented during the years. But it is the fused deposition modeling (FDM) which was one of the first invented that is considered the most popular today. Even though the FDM process is the most popular, it still suffers from some issues. This thesis looks at the possibility of removing these issues by using a 5-axis system. To explore this, a 5-axis FDM printer called the Pentarod have been created by extending a 3-axis FDM printer with two extra axes. Then parts that can simulate the two main issues of a FDM printer have been printed with the Pentarod to see if it can elliminate the lacks of a 3-axis FDM printer. The Pentarod have been made successfully, and it have been able to print the parts without problems. By managing this Pentarod have shown that by adding two extra axes to a FDM printer, the two main issues for the FDM process can be eliminated.

^KEYrefTitle

> <span class="highlight" style="background-color: #ffd40050">FDM printers still have some weaknesses including accuracy and their inability to print overhanging structures without support [50]. The accuracy can be improved to some extent by lowering the layer height and using a nozzle with a smaller diameter. Even though the accuracy is improved by these methods, there will still be problems when printing surfaces that are not parallel with the print plate. An example of this can be seen in Figure 1.1. When improving the accuracy of the printer by lowering the layer height or using a nozzle with a smaller diameter, the print time for a part will be extended. As an example, by lowering the layer height from 0.4 mm to 0.2 mm, the amount of layers will be doubled and accordingly the print time</span>  
> FDM打印机仍然存在一些缺点，包括精度和无法打印无支撑的悬垂结构[ 50 ]。通过降低层高和使用直径较小的喷嘴，可以在一定程度上提高精度。即使通过这些方法提高了精度，但在打印与印版不平行的曲面时仍会出现问题。这方面的例子可以参见图1.1。当通过降低层高或使用直径较小的喷头来提高打印机的精度时，会延长零件的打印时间。举例来说，通过降低层高从0.4 mm到0.2 mm，层的数量将加倍，相应的打印时间 ([p3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BDK5Z5XT?page=3&annotation=H6KFBYFB))

When using a nozzle with a smaller diameter the print time will also increase, because the volume of the plastic the printer can extrude will be dramatically reduced [58]. Time is also a problem when using support material to print structures with overhangs, as the support structure creates more work for the FDM printer.</span>  
> 将近翻倍。当使用直径较小的喷头时，打印时间也会增加，因为打印机可以挤出的塑料体积会大幅减少[ 58 ]。当使用支撑材料打印带有悬垂的结构时，时间也是一个问题，因为支撑结构为FDM打印机创造了更多的工作。 ([p4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/BDK5Z5XT?page=4&annotation=I6R9ZCPV))
